Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.Ageing is associated with various ailments including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is a progressive form of dementia. AD symptoms develop over a period of years and, unfortunately, there is no cure. Existing AD treatments can only slow down the progression of symptoms and thus it is critical to diagnose the disease at an early stage. To help improve theearly diagnosis of AD, a deep learning-based classification model with an embedded feature selection approach was used to classify AD patients.
By examining current research and scientific literature, the project sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of the disease. This mini project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Alzheimer's disease, including its causes, symptoms, and implications.
In current circumstances, the standard measurements and human instinct don’t frequently work. That is the reason we must depend on intensively computational and non-traditional approaches such as machine learning. The custom of using machine learning as a part of disease prediction and visualization is a fragment of an expanding shift towards prescient and customized prescription. 
This drift is important, not only for the patients in increasing their quality of life and life style, but for physicians in making treatment decisions and also for health economists. It’s not the disease of age, it’s the disease of the brain and patients may show Symptoms like loss of memory, difficulty in finding the right words or understanding what people are saying, difficulty in performing previously routine tasks and personality and mood changes. 
When a radiologist views a medical report e.g., a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of a patient, a biased thinking for a disease would result in missing the chance of detecting other disease conditions.
Thus, it leads to considering only a subset of causes and conditions. An increased workload, stress, fatigue, cognitive bias,and poor systemare some ofthe factors behind it. In this situation, smart diagnostic systems provide a safe clinical support to the clinicians. The Alzheimer’s association claims that AD is the sixth leading cause of death in United States.
